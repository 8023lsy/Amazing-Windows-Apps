# Windows Apps That Amaze Us

###### Inspired by GitHub repo [Awesome Windows](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome)

This is to introduce amazing works done onto Windows. All apps collected in this book will be:

1. greatly featured.
2. invasive ads free. But if there is non-invasive ads, this apps should be completely free itself. If users are required to pay, there should NOT be any ads.
3. privacy respecting: here I mean this app or app provider will NEVER share private info with any 3rd party unless you ask for it or under legal requirements.
4. actively maintained. If it stops being maintained, it will be removed from here.
5. easy to learn throughout.

All apps are sorted in alphabetical order.

Note: these following appps will NOT be listed although may deserve a try:

1. fixed or cracked versions, e.g. ads-peeling versions, which can feel cool.
2. strict regoinal purpose, e.g. NPR One Desktop, Pinyin Input, etc.
