# Windows Apps That Amaze Us

###### Inspired by GitHub repo [Awesome Windows](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome)

This is to introduce amazing works done onto Windows. All apps collected in this book will be:

1. greatly featured.
2. invasive ads free. But if there is non-invasive ads, this apps should be completely free itself. If users are required to pay, there should NOT be any ads.
3. privacy respecting.
4. actively maintained. If it stops being maintained, it will be removed from here.
5. easy to learn throughout.

All apps are sorted in alphabetical order.

Note: for some apps, there can be fixed or cracked versions, e.g. ads-peeling versions, which feel cool but will NOT be listed here.
